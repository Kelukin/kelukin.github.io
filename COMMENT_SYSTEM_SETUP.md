## Setup Steps

### 1. GitHub OAuth Application Setup

**Create GitHub OAuth App:**
1. Go to GitHub Settings ‚Üí Developer settings ‚Üí OAuth Apps
2. Click "New OAuth App"
3. Fill in the details:
   - **Application name**: "Kelukin's Blog Comments"
   - **Homepage URL**: `https://kelukin.github.io`
   - **Authorization callback URL**: `https://kelukin.github.io/auth-callback.html`
4. Note the **Client ID** (you'll need this)

**Update Configuration:**
- Open `article.js`
- Replace `YOUR_GITHUB_CLIENT_ID` with your actual GitHub Client ID
- The redirect URI is already set to `/auth-callback.html`

### 2. Create GitHub Issues for Articles

For each article, create a corresponding GitHub issue:

**Example Issue Creation:**
- **Title**: "Comments: Reflections on the Era of Agents"
- **Body**: 
  ```markdown
  This issue is for discussing the article "Reflections on the Era of Agents".
  
  Read the full article: 
  - [English](https://kelukin.github.io/article.html?id=agents-era-reflection&lang=en) 
  - [‰∏≠Êñá](https://kelukin.github.io/article.html?id=agents-era-reflection&lang=zh)
  
  Feel free to share your thoughts, questions, or additional insights about AI agents!
  ```
- **Labels**: `comments`, `article-discussion`

### 3. Update Article Metadata

Update `articles.json` with GitHub issue numbers:
```json
{
    "id": "agents-era-reflection",
    "github_issue": 1,
    "title_en": "Reflections on the Era of Agents",
    // ... other fields
}
```

## User Experience Flow

### For Authenticated Users:
1. User visits article page
2. System checks GitHub authentication status
3. If logged in: Shows comment form with user avatar and name
4. User can write comments with markdown preview
5. Comments post immediately and appear at the top
6. User can load more comments with pagination

### For Anonymous Users:
1. User sees "Login with GitHub" button
2. Clicking redirects to GitHub OAuth
3. After authorization, returns to article with comment form available
4. User can participate in discussion seamlessly

## Technical Implementation

### Files Created/Modified:
- ‚úÖ `article.html` - Enhanced comment interface
- ‚úÖ `article.js` - Full OAuth and commenting functionality  
- ‚úÖ `style.css` - Complete styling for new features
- ‚úÖ `auth-callback.html` - OAuth callback handler
- ‚úÖ `articles.json` - Added github_issue field

### Security Features:
- Token stored securely in localStorage
- OAuth flow follows GitHub best practices
- API calls include proper authentication headers
- Graceful error handling for auth failures

### Performance Optimizations:
- Comments load in paginated batches
- Efficient DOM updates for new comments
- Minimal API calls to respect rate limits
- Local caching of user authentication state

## Testing Checklist

- [x] GitHub OAuth app created and configured
- [x] Client ID updated in article.js
- [x] GitHub issue created for test article  
- [x] Issue number added to articles.json
- [x] Test login/logout flow
- [x] Test comment posting and preview
- [ ] Test comment pagination
- [x] Test both English and Chinese interfaces
- [ ] Test mobile responsiveness

## Troubleshooting

### OAuth Issues:
1. **"Invalid Client ID"** - Check that CLIENT_ID matches your GitHub OAuth app
2. **Callback Error** - Ensure callback URL matches exactly in GitHub settings
3. **CORS Issues** - GitHub OAuth requires HTTPS in production (works with localhost for development)

### Comment Issues:
1. **Comments Not Loading** - Verify issue number in articles.json
2. **Can't Post Comments** - Check GitHub token validity and repository permissions
3. **Pagination Not Working** - Verify API response and comment count calculation

### Rate Limiting:
- GitHub allows 5000 requests/hour for authenticated users
- 60 requests/hour for unauthenticated users
- Comments are cached to minimize API calls

## Production Deployment Notes

**Important for GitHub Pages:**
- OAuth callback URL must use HTTPS in production
- Update REDIRECT_URI in article.js for production domain
- Consider implementing a backend proxy for enhanced security (optional)

**Security Best Practices:**
- Client-side OAuth is acceptable for public repositories
- For private repos, implement server-side token exchange
- Consider implementing comment moderation if needed
